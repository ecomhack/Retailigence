# Retailigence

API for special offers in the near of the current location.

## Concept ##

The idea is that a shop owner provides special offers for his location.

These offers are pushed to the cloud and send as push notifications to users in the near and personialized and filtered by specific conditions (depending on the weather, e.g.).

An interested user can purchase an offer and directly pay via PayPal.

An offer is also pushed to social networks like Google+, Facebook or Twitter.
